CV website
This site is meant to be some kind of portfolio in which I do random applications to show my skills in JS and frameworks!

-------
There is no back end curently, the login screen will work on every password that match following requirments:
* Login has to be 4-16 characters length
* Password has to be 8-255 characters length

The database with node will be added with 4th application, which is storehouse application. The beta of this application can be found at https://github.com/Voinek/magazine/tree/master but it will be added here at the end of this month.

I will try to add one application to this portfolio every month. It's hard to do work, studies and programming at the same time.
